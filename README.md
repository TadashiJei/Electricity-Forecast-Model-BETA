# Electricity Forecast Model - Forecast FastAPI Branch

This branch introduces an enhanced structure for the Electricity Forecast Model, with a focus on modular design and improved API development using FastAPI. This model predicts electricity consumption patterns based on historical data, providing insights for energy management and optimization.

For additional details and previous information on the project, please refer to the original README in the main branch.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Separation of core components such as models, services, and API endpoints.
- **Centralized Configuration**: Environment and model configurations are managed from a single location for consistency.
- **Routing System**: A modular routing setup improves API scalability and readability.
- **Clean Dependency Management**: Dependencies are managed using FastAPIâ€™s dependency injection.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Structured error messages and responses provide a robust experience for end-users.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone -b forecast-fastapi https://github.com/TadashiJei/Electricity-Forecast-Model-BETA.git
   cd Electricity-Forecast-Model-BETA
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the API

1. **Start the Server**

   Use the following command to run the FastAPI server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

2. **Access the API**

   The API will be available at:
   
   - **Prediction Endpoint**: [http://localhost:8000/api/v1/predict](http://localhost:8000/api/v1/predict)
   - **Documentation**: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) (Auto-generated by FastAPI)

## API Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **Models**: Contains the prediction models used for electricity forecasting.
- **Services**: Handles business logic and data processing.
- **API**: FastAPI endpoints to serve model predictions and provide RESTful access.
- **Config**: Centralized configuration management for environment and runtime settings.

## Example Usage

Make a POST request to the `/api/v1/predict` endpoint with JSON data in the following format:

```json
{
    "timestamp": "2024-10-27T12:00:00",
    "temperature": 22.5,
    "humidity": 60
}
```

Expected JSON response:

```json
{
    "timestamp": "2024-10-27T12:00:00",
    "predicted_consumption": 450.3,
    "confidence_interval": [440.0, 460.5]
}
```

---

## Development and Testing

To add or test new features:

1. **Testing**

   Run tests to ensure all functionality works as expected:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

2. **Linting**

   Lint your code for style consistency:

   ```bash
   flake8 .
   ```
